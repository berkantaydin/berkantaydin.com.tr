I got a Netflix ID. Because i have to improve my English speaking and understanding skills. I really need this because i hate to read subtitles. Because it's very boring while watching TV. You can't see any mimics and other visual things. When i surfing in first time at Netflix, i saw *Ramsey GORDON: Kitchen Nightmares*.

I watched him before at Hell's Kitchen and other TV programs. I really love him because i think he is very good chief and his comminication skills is simple and best for us. He know your job and his job is my favorite. I really like him. I will keep watcing Ramsey GORDON. I will f**king watch!

...and some words from Ramsey...
